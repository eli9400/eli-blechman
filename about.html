          The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana,

              <h2>Traditional colors</h2>
              <p>
                The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New
                Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first
                specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the
                lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that
                balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown
                why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest
                that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic
                appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.[39][40] Errol Laborde,
                author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex
                Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on
                heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture,
                and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent
                their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty,
                while white was already heavily used on other national flags,
                and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in
                green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of
                tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be
                placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be
                placed on or next to other colors.[39] Following a color-themed
                Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored
                floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization
                retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
                symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are
                commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that
                order—even though this order technically violates the rule of
                tincture.

              <h2>20th and 21st centuries</h2>
              <p>
                In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The
                official parades were canceled or moved to surrounding
                communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly
                fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming,
                and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops
                maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or
                property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality
                or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter
                bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras
                ever. In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance
                that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes,
                to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis
                of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain
                parade permits and other public licenses.[9] Shortly after the
                law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them
                with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions
                of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In
                protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it
                jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the
                19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.[10]
                Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also
                suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade
                schedule in 2000. Several organizations brought suit against the
                city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
                courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional
                infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and
                an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to
                the ordinance.[11] The US Supreme Court refused to hear the
                city's appeal from this decision. Today, New Orleans krewes
                operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone
                who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a parade
                float.
